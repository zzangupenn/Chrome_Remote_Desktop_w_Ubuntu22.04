# Chrome_Remote_Desktop_w_Ubuntu22.04

The author has been using Teamviewer or Anydesk for remote working. Although these apps are good for Windows and Mac, they suffer laggyness, disconnection more than they should on Linux.
Chrome Remote Desktop (CRD) gives much better smoothness, crispyness, and responsiveness. It creates a new window session instead of recording the screen. However, I find `gnome` having issue with CRD. 
The solution I find is to use `xfce4` for the CRD.

1. Follow [the guideline](https://remotedesktop.google.com/headless) to install CRD.
2. Then install and set `xfce4`
```
sudo apt install xfce4 xfce4-goodies -y
echo 'exec /usr/bin/xfce4-session' > ~/.chrome-remote-desktop-session
sudo reboot
```

### üîê Fixing Annoying Password Prompts in GNOME after Installing XFCE on Ubuntu
When you install `xfce4`, it installs its own polkit agent (xfce-polkit) and possibly overrides or disables GNOME‚Äôs more permissive behavior. The Fix: Explicit `.pkla` Rules:

```
sudo mkdir -p /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/
sudo nano /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/95-desktop-privileges.pkla
```
Copy in:
```
[Allow NetworkManager actions]
Identity=unix-user:<your_username>
Action=org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.*
ResultAny=yes
ResultInactive=yes
ResultActive=yes

[Allow UDisks2 mounting]
Identity=unix-user:<your_username>
Action=org.freedesktop.udisks2.*
ResultAny=yes
ResultInactive=yes
ResultActive=yes

[Allow ColorManager: create profile]
Identity=unix-user:<your_username>
Action=org.freedesktop.color-manager.*
ResultAny=yes
ResultInactive=yes
ResultActive=yes
```
Restart `polkit` and reboot:
```
sudo systemctl restart polkit
reboot
```

### Prevent Session Termination via Logind
This is a known issue on Ubuntu with GNOME where after a long idle period or suspend, the user session is terminated or corrupted in a way that prevents successful login via GUI‚Äîeven with the correct password. 
1. Edit your `logind.conf` to prevent the session from being stopped:
```
sudo nano /etc/systemd/logind.conf
```
2. Uncomment:
```
KillUserProcesses=no
```
3. Then restart systemd-logind:
```
sudo systemctl restart systemd-logind
```


### ‚ùå Known issue with OpenGL
While the GPU is accessible in the remote session, the OpenGL backend has issues and will fall back to the CPU.
